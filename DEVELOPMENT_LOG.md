## 📅 Daily Changelog & Feature Timeline

### 🗓️ 2026-10-08 (Active Release — Pre-Search AI Concierge & 3-AI Memory Sync)

* **Status**: 🟢 Implemented & Live locally (`http://localhost:3000`)
* **Key Focus**: Conversational Pre-Search AI Shopping Concierge, Query Optimization, and Shared Session Memory across 3 AIs.

#### 🌟 New Features & Architectural Integrations:
1. **Clean Separation of Direct Search & Optional AI Shopping Guide**:
   - **Normal Search**: 100% direct, frictionless, 0 delay when typing in search bar and pressing Enter or clicking "Search".
   - **ShopSmart AI Guide**: Optional consultant accessed via `[ ✨ AI Guide ]` button when user feels confused and wants advice.
2. **True Conversational Advisor UI (No Screen-Blocking Forms)**:
   - Completely removed the intrusive `OPTIMIZED SEARCH READY` green box that interrupted chat flow.
   - Clean, natural ChatGPT-style consultation dialog where the user can freely explore specs, brands, and trade-offs.
   - **Strict 2-4 Word Smart Query Rule**: Irrespective of conversation length, the AI extracts only 2-4 core anchor keywords (e.g. `Ryzen 5 laptop`, `RTX 3050 laptop`) ensuring e-commerce APIs (Amazon/Flipkart) never fail from query bloat.
   - **Non-Intrusive Search Triggers**:
     - 1-Click Action Chip in the chip list: `[ 🚀 Search: "RTX 3050 laptop" ]`
     - Compact 1-line footer indicator: `Smart Query: "RTX 3050 laptop" [ Search Deals → ]`
3. **Unified 3-AI Shared Memory Sync**:
   - Concierge sets `{ userPersona, userRequirement, budgetLimit, conciergeSummary }` directly into `aiSessionLedger`.
   - Naturally consumed by **AI Summarization** (`ProductCard` -> `/api/ai/review`) and **In-App Chat** (`InChatShoppingAgent.jsx`) without altering either component.
   - Strictly preserved: **Zero changes made to `InChatShoppingAgent.jsx` and `/api/ai/review/route.js`**.

### 🗓️ 2026-10-07 (Previous Release)

* **Git Commit**: `7d6f74a`
* **Commit Message**: `feat: carousel comparison, pixel-perfect card alignment, pure metadata specs, and in-browser price alerts`
* **Status**: ✅ Pushed to GitHub `main`

#### 🌟 New Features & Enhancements Added:
1. **Interactive Carousel Comparison (`HeadToHeadModal.jsx`)**:
   - Replaced static lists with a fluid carousel/slider for selecting the second product for side-by-side comparison.
   - Removed distracting floating compare dock / bottom notification banner from `page.js`.
2. **Pure Metadata-Driven Specifications (No Rules, 0 Extra API Calls)**:
   - Eliminated hardcoded category `if/else` rule trees in both backend and prompt.
   - Initial 20-product search response directly supplies merchant `product_attributes` and descriptions.
   - AI extracts genuine specifications strictly from the product's actual metadata (Fabric/Fit for clothing, Hardware/RAM for laptops, Capacity/Stars for appliances).
   - Rendered sleek dark-theme **"Verified Technical & Hardware Sheet"** (`Real-Time AI Verified ✓`) inside the "Ask AI" modal.
3. **Zero-Email In-Browser Price Drop Tracker (`PriceDropModal.jsx`)**:
   - Replaced legacy email collection forms with instant in-browser push alerts and LocalStorage price tracking.
   - Accessible from both the card's Price Alert button and inside the Ask AI modal.
4. **Saved Deals Drawer (`SavedDealsDrawer.jsx`)**:
   - Added instant bookmarking drawer for user deal shortlisting without mandatory login friction.
5. **High-Contrast Re-Designed Action Buttons**:
   - Polished Market Avg section with distinct Amber/Gold **Price Alert** pill and Indigo **Compare Stores** pill.

#### 🛠️ Bugs & UI Alignment Fixed:
* **Pixel-Perfect Horizontal Button Alignment**:
  - Completely removed the uneven `VERIFIED TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS` checkmark list from the card face.
  - Pinned both main CTAs (`✨ Ask AI About This Product` and `Buy Directly at {Store}`) inside `mt-auto pt-3 flex flex-col gap-2` at the bottom of each card.
  - Added `min-h-[44px]` to title `<h3>` so 1-line and 2-line product titles remain level.
  - All cards across rows and carousels now maintain identical horizontal button alignment.
* **Syntax / Variable Deduplication**:
  - Removed duplicate `rawKeys` declaration in `src/services/rapidapi.js`.
